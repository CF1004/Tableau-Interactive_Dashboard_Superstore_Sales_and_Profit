# 📊 Superstore Sales & Profit Performance Dashboard
Interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing sales and profit performance across product categories, time, and U.S. regions using the Sample Superstore dataset.

## 🎯 Overview
This visualization answers key business performance questions:
- How have Sales and Profit trended over time?
- Which product categories and sub-categories are most profitable?
- Which regions drive the strongest sales performance?

The dashboard allows users to explore performance from multiple business angles, interactively.
